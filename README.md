# Introduction
This repository contains the work performed during the final year R & D Project at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I worked with my peer Purushotham Mani under the supervision of Prof Avinash Bharwaj, Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, IITB.

# Guide
- For a detailed description, methodology, and results of the project, the manuscript [Drone Delivery Optimization.pdf](https://github.com/saayuj/Drone-Delivery-Optimization/blob/main/Drone%20Delivery%20Optimization.pdf) can be viewed. The manuscript has also been uploaded on arXiv. [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17375)
- The project proposal and final poster for presentation are also added.
- A guide to the various folders:
1. The main optimization codes written to solve the various cases can be found in [python_codes](https://github.com/saayuj/Drone-Delivery-Optimization/tree/main/python_codes).
2. The optimization log files for each case can be found in [log_files](https://github.com/saayuj/Drone-Delivery-Optimization/tree/main/log_files).
3. The results for all the cases can be found in [images_GIFs](https://github.com/saayuj/Drone-Delivery-Optimization/tree/main/images_GIFs).
